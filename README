= Wordpress posts

See wp.xml

= Import wp to individual yaml posts

First, make sure you have 'save_to_yaml(load_wp(ARGV[0]))' UNcommented inside wp2gh.rb

  ruby wp2gh.rb wp.xml

This writes the '.yml' files to ./_raw and the '.textile' to ./_posts

= Updating a post

Edit the individual yaml file. Then, make sure 'save_to_yaml(load_wp(ARGV[0]))' is COMMENTED.

  ruby wp2gh.rb
  git add .
  git commit -m 'your message'
  git push
