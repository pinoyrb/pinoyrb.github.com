  <p>I got a Peepcode unlimited last year which came with a nice video about the command line. <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/advanced-command-line" >Check it out</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Not too many people will find this interesting. For me, it's something I just want to do for myself (and for those I'd work for if I'm still employed).</p>
  
  <h2>Aliases matter</h2> 
  
  
  <p>I haven't organized my aliases into a separate file as shown in the video but I am using some useful aliases right now.</p>
  
  <p>These are some of the aliases I have:</p>
  
  <pre class="brush: ruby">
  alias start_mysql="/Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM start"
  alias stop_mysql="/Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM stop"
  #adds all new and modified files for a git repository
  alias ga="git add ."
  #adds all new files for subversion 
  alias sa="svn status | grep "^\?" | sed -e 's/? *//' | sed -e 's/ /\\ /g' | xargs svn add"
  </pre>
  
  
  <p>I find Rails 3 commands much more confusing than the old ones although they seem to be nearly the same. Plus it gets a little  complex considering I'm using different versions. For those following through my posts regarding Rails on OS X/ Linux, you'd probably find this useful.</p>
  
  <pre class="brush: ruby">
  #The new command to install a plugin in Rails 3 (subject to change - probably) 
  ruby script/rails plugin install plugin_repository
  </pre>
  
  
  <p>A little long right? This is what I need for sanity:</p>
  
  <pre class="brush: ruby">
  alias plugin_install="ruby script/rails plugin install"
  #use Rails3 for Ruby 1.8.7 
  alias r3="rvm 1.8.7%rails3"
  #use Rails3 version and starts the rails app
  alias rs="rvm 1.8.7%rails3 && rails server"
  </pre>
  
  
  <p>Sweet. Now I can sleep. Zzzz...</p>
