<p>At one point or another, you&#8217;ll need this functionality:</p>

<p><code>Find all people whose names start with Jo Sm</code> &lt;- (i.e. the famous John Smith)</p>

<h2 id='step_1_make_it_work'>Step 1. Make it work</h2>

<p>How do we go about that in SOLR (specifically using sunspot?). Here&#8217;s my brain dump based off of a gist:</p>
<script src='http://gist.github.com/509529.js?file=sunspot-text-starting-with-explanation.rb' />
<p>Turns out, <strong><code>starting_with</code> in conjunction with a <code>text</code> index works only for a string in lowercase form.</strong> No biggie, we just have to remember.</p>

<h2 id='step_2_make_it_pretty'>Step 2. Make it pretty?</h2>

<p>Doing that for every type of search for lots of fields will quickly become cumbersome. How do we clean that up? Why a DSL of course!</p>

<p>Luckily ruby allows us to extend classes pretty easily. We can do the following:</p>
<script src='http://gist.github.com/509546.js?file=sunspot-ext.rb' />
<p>After that, the example above will look a lot simpler:</p>
<script src='http://gist.github.com/509550.js?file=dsl-example.rb' />
