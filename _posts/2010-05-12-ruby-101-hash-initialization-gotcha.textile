I have a code that counts how many times a word occurs - a perfect fit for Hash. 

<pre class="brush: ruby">
def word_counts(words)
  counts = Hash.new(0)
  words.each do |word|
    counts[word] += 1
  end
end

categories = {
  :a => word_counts(‘some text’)
  :b => word_counts(‘another set of text’)
}
</pre>

Somewhere, I use the hash returned by the word_counts method to do some calculation.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
def score(word_scores, words)
  words.each do |word|
    v = word_scores[word]
    v = 0.1 if v.nil?

    score += Math.log( v / some_value )
  end
end

categories.each do |category, word_counts|
  score(word_counts, %w{some random text})
end
</pre>

When I run the score, I always get an ‘Infinity’.  After some debugging, the problem is this piece of code:

<pre class="brush: ruby">
v = word_scores[word]
v = 0.1 if v.nil?
</pre>

‘word_scores’  returns 0 if  ‘word’ doesn’t exist; not nil which is the default behavior. Later, I realized I initialized it via   Hash.new(0) which makes 0 the default value.  In fact, it is not even necessary to check for nil or 0. All we want is to retrieve the value referenced by the key, and if the key does not exist, give me 0.1.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
v = word_counts.fetch word, 0.1
</pre>

By the way, the code is from a simple exercise on <a href="http://www.rubyoncloud.org/questions/how-to-classify-text-as-spam-or-funny-or-what-have-you-using-naive-bayes-algorithm">Naive Bayes algorithm to classify text</a>.
