<p>The keynote is about Rails 3.0 and the many enhancements it bring to make web application development more fun.  The improvements in writing database queries (via <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/screencasts/rails3/active-relation-active-model">ActiveRelation</a>), routes, ActionMailer are really neat and I believe would make it easier for  developers to get on board with Rails.</p>
<p>The official release will be available in a few weeks but the current version is already good enough for production use according to DHH.</p>
