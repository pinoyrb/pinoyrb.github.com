<p>Just thought I might share this. Who said only "nobody's" are using Rails?</p>

<p>amazon.com - <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/11/29/amazon-goes-ruby-on-rails" rel="nofollow">Amazon goes Ruby on Rails</a></p>

<p>BBC - <a href="http://sam-sys.com/component/content/article/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=73" rel="nofollow">Who is using Ruby on Rails?</a></p>

<p>CapGemini - <a href="http://justaddwater.dk/2007/02/13/danish-newspaper-interview-capgemini-on-rails/" rel="nofollow">Danish Newspaper Interview: Capgemini on Rails</a></p>

<p>EA (Electronic Arts)</p>

<p>IBM</p>

<p>JP Morgan</p>

<p>NASA</p>

<p>Oakley</p>

<p>Oracle</p>

<p>Siemens</p>

<p>ThoughtWorks â™«</p>

<p>Yahoo!</p>

<p>And the list goes on...</p>

<p>Of course they are also using PHP5, Python, Java and other languages. There should be no reason to just confine yourself to using Rails. I use Sinatra and have been itching to use Django too.</p>

<p>Programming isn't like being in a prison although confinement can lead to enlightenment. Happiness and enlightenment can be achieved by discovering what works for you.</p>
