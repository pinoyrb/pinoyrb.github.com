<p>The <a href="http://community.openamplify.com/blogs/quickstart/pages/overview.aspx">OpenAmplify API</a> reads text you supply and returns linguistic data explaining and classifying the content. What you do with that analysis is, in the fine tradition of APIs and mashups, up to you. Some possibilities might include pairing ads with articles, creating rich tag-clouds, or monitoring the tone of forum threads.</p>
<p>I created a ruby gem to simplify the use of the OpenAmplify API. It&#8217;s still in the early stages but should be enough to get you started.</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: bash;">
    gem install openamplify
</pre>

<p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: ruby;">
    require 'openamplify'

    API_KEY = 'register to get a key'
    client = OpenAmplify::Client.new(:api_key => API_KEY)

    text = 'After getting the MX1000 laser mouse and the Z-5500 speakers i fell in love with logitech'
    response = client.analyze_text(text)

    # List all the keys and values returned by OpenAmplify
    response.each do |k, v|
      pp k
      pp v
    end

    # 'response' works like a Hash
    puts response['Topics']
    puts response['Demographics']
</pre>

<p><strong>Output Format</strong></p>
<p>In case you need a different format, OpenAmplify supports XML, JSON, RDF, CSV. It can also return the result as a fancy HTML page.</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby;">
    # assuming you use Nokogiri
    doc = Nokogiri::XML(response.to_xml)

    # or you want a JSON
    json = JSON.parse(response.to_json)

    # you should really try the pretty formats
    puts response.to_pretty
    # or
    puts response.to_signals
</pre>
